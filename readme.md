## Application for face detection:
### 1. Template matching app
Face recognition app that use OpenCV template matching     
### 2. Viola-Jones 
Face recognition app that use OpenCV Cascade Classifier  
__Xml folder should have corresponding xml files from this link https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
### 3. Face recognition system using features from histogram, gradient, scaled images, DCT and DFT
Face recognition app-classifier. 5 methods avaliable for feature extraction. Classification results based on distance (usually l1) between extracted vectors.
### 3. Paintings recognition system  
Paintings recognition system using GLCM, SIFT descriptors, Shi-Tomasi corner detector for feature extraction and RandomForest as classifier  
Note: test images filesnames sholud be strictly like "'filename'__uniquenum.jpg" Example: abstract__1.jpg
